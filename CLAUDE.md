## Development Principles

- TDD with failure loops - write failing test first, then implement
- Tests must only output on failure (quiet success, loud failure)
- No mocks - use real integrations in tests
- Refactor freely, no backwards compatibility shims
- No re-export shims - when code moves, update all import sites to point to the new location instead of leaving behind proxy re-exports
- Ask questions early - liberally use AskUserQuestion when requirements are unclear or ambiguous

## Commands
