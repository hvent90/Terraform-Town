# Codrops — "Blended Material Shader in WebGL with Solid.js"

**Date:** August 2025
**URL:** https://tympanus.net/codrops/2025/08/12/building-a-blended-material-shader-in-webgl-with-solid-js/

## Overview

Great practical insight: reducing from six lights to just two delivered identical visual results at 120fps vs 30fps — a lesson in performant moody lighting.

## Key Techniques

- Light optimization
- Performance vs visual quality tradeoff
- Blended materials
- WebGL with Solid.js

## Key Insight

> Reducing from six lights to just two delivered identical visual results at 120fps vs 30fps

## Why Relevant

Critical lesson: fewer lights with better placement can achieve same visual effect with 4x performance improvement.
